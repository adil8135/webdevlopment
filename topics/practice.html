    <p>Chandrayaan-3 is the third Indian lunar exploration mission under the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Chandrayaan program. It consists of a lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan, similar to those of the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The spacecraft was launched on 14 July 2023 and entered lunar orbit on 5 August. On 23 August 2023, the lander touched down in the lunar south pole region, making India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon and the first to do so near the lunar south pole.2 The mission aims to demonstrate end-to-end landing and roving capabilities and make scientific measurements on the surface and from orbit. The lander/rover will be similar to the Vikram rover on Chandrayaan 2, with improvements to help ensure a safe landing.1 The rover has successfully traversed a distance of about 8 meters on the lunar surface, and all payloads on the propulsion module, lander module, and rover are performing nominally.0
